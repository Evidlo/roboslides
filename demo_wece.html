# Roboslides is Just Markdown

You can use all the normal features of Markdown!  E.g. here is a code snippet

``` python
print('hello')

class Baz:
    def biz(self, x):
    print(x)
```

Just include this line at the bottom of your Markdown!

``` html
<script src="https://evidlo.github.io/roboslides/remark.js"></script>
```

# Themes
